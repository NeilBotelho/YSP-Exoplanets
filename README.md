# YSP Exoplanets Project


## Goals
This repository contains the results of my work in the Young Scientist program in which I researched 2 things:
1. How effective are certain machine learning models in predicting whether a given exoplanet is habitable 
2. Can machine learning be used to predict which features are most important in predicting whether or not a planet is habitable

## Structure of this repo
A documented summary with my code and comments explaining it is availble in the [Exoplanets.ipynb](https://github.com/NeilBotelho/YSP-Exoplanets/blob/master/Exoplanets.ipynb) jupyter notebook in the top level directory of the repository

The scripts and datasets I used for Goal #1 are in the TrainingModels directory

The scripts and datasets I used for Goal #2 are in the MostImportantFeatures directory
