# YSP Exoplanets Project


## Goals
This repository contains the results of my work in the [Young Scientist Program](https://www.bmsis.org/ysp/) in which I researched 2 things:
1. How effective are certain machine learning algorithms in predicting whether a given exoplanet is habitable 
2. Can machine learning be used to predict which features are most important in predicting whether or not a planet is habitable

## Structure of this repo
A documented summary with my code and comments explaining it is availble in the Exoplanets.ipynb jupyter notebook in the top level directory of the repository

The scripts and datasets I used for Goal #1 are in the TrainingModels directory

The scripts and datasets I used for Goal #2 are in the MostImportantFeatures directory
